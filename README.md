# WinPaletter Store for Themes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WinPaletter now allows you to **add and publish themes directly** in the app starting from **version `1.0.9.8` and higher**. You can manage, upload, and share your custom themes seamlessly. (A dedicated Wiki will provide detailed guidance on this feature.)

### Important Notes for Uploading Themes:

1. **Copyright Responsibility**  
   You are fully responsible for the copyrights of any themes or resource packs you upload. The WinPaletter developer is **not responsible** for any copyright violations caused by uploaded content.

2. **Handling Copyright Violations**  
   If a copyright violation is detected, please **open an issue** in this repository. The theme may need to be modified to respect copyrights or removed entirely.

3. **Theme Version Compatibility**  
   Only themes created with **WinPaletter 1.0.7.7 or higher** are supported.  
   - If your theme was created in an older version, update to WinPaletter 1.0.7.7 or higher.  
   - Use the **convert button** in the main form (top area) to upgrade your theme to the latest format before uploading.
   - This conversion feature is not available in recent updates, so use version 1.0.7.7 to convert your theme.
